                <p>Front End UI for Transaction Enrichment project. The project aim was to create an improved view of transactions which included more merchant data, categorisation, tagging, spending insights etc. My role was to take the existing Front End for the less rich versions of these pages (statements and details) and add new markup and styles to accommodate the new and improved data we would be showing. A whole new UI for details was needed as well as new pages for Categorisation Management and Spending Insights.</p>
                <p>Skills used included standard HTML markup (using Bootstrap framework) alongside CSS (LESS), JS and jQuery, SVN was the chosen source control and all was built using Visual Studio. Working alongside BA, PM, Back end devs (both internal and external).</p>
